# WumpusAdventures — Gameplay Specification

This document defines the rules, mechanics, and systems of **WumpusAdventures**.

## 1. World Structure
- **Play Area**: A grid whose size grows with the level (from 5×8 up to 10×20, see `core/difficulty/difficulty.ts`).
- **Coordinate System**: Internally a 1D index where `0` is top-left and `rows*cols - 1` is bottom-right.
- **Fog of War**: Most tiles start as unvisited (hidden). Moving into a tile reveals it persistently.

## 2. Movement Rules
- **Input**: The player moves in four cardinal directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
- **Wall Interaction**: Attempting to move into a boundary will update the player's **Facing Direction** but will not change their position.
- **Cost**: Every move has a base cost of **-1 point**.
- **Exploration**: Visiting a new tile for the first time awards **+5 points**.

## 3. Hazards & Interaction
The game board contains several hidden threats:

| Hazard | Behavior | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enemy (Guardian)** | Stationary. | **Game Over** on impact (a shield, when active, absorbs one hit). |
| **Pit (Vortex)** | Stationary. | Teleports the player to a random safe tile (unvisited tiles first). Landing on an enemy is fatal. |

> **Planned, not implemented:** hidden *traps* (-75 points) and *power-ups* (shield pickups). The shield flag exists in the engine but nothing grants it yet.

### Proximity Detection
The player can "hear" hazards through audio loops:
- **Monster Near**: Localized growling sounds.
- **Lava Near**: Bubbling sounds indicating a pit is adjacent.

## 4. Combat Logic
Players are equipped with arrows to defend themselves.
- **Attack**: Firing an arrow consumes 1 attack charge and travels exactly 1 tile in the **Facing Direction**.
- **Hit**: Killing an enemy awards high points and increases the **Enemy Combo**.
- **Miss**: Firing into an empty tile or a wall results in a **-25 point** penalty and resets the combo to zero.

## 5. Scoring System
Final scores are calculated based on efficiency and risk-taking.

| Action | Score | Scaling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step (Base)** | -1 | No |
| **New Tile** | +5 | No |
| **Collect Coin** | +100 | **Yes (Level Multiplier)** |
| **Kill Enemy** | +250 × combo | Combo only |
| **Attack Miss** | -25 | No |
| **Level Clear** | +500 | **Yes (Level Multiplier)** |

### Multipliers
- **Level Multiplier**: `1 + (Level - 1) * 0.2`. Coin and level-clear rewards increase by 20% per level.
- **Enemy Combo**: Hits cap at a **3x multiplier** for consecutive kills without moving or missing.

## 6. Level Progression
- **Victory Condition**: Collect **all coins** on the current board (3 at level 1, capped at 8).
- **Level Up**: Clears the board, resets player to starting position, and generates a new, more difficult level.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Board size, enemies, pits and coins grow with the level. Every generated board is validated so that all coins are reachable without crossing a hazard.
